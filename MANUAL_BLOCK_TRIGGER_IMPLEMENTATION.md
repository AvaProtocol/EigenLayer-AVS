# Manual Block Trigger Immediate Execution Implementation

## Overview

This implementation enables manual block triggers to provide real blockchain data by instructing the operator to execute triggers immediately with current block information, rather than using minimal placeholder data.

## Architecture

### Aggregator Side (`core/taskengine/engine.go`)

1. **TriggerTask Method Enhancement**: When a manual block trigger is requested, instead of using the original simulation logic, the aggregator now:
   - Detects block trigger type in the request
   - Calls `instructOperatorImmediateTrigger()` to send an instruction to connected operators
   - Returns success response indicating trigger initiation

2. **instructOperatorImmediateTrigger Function**: 
   - Gets current block number from RPC connection
   - Creates `ImmediateTrigger` notification for all connected operators
   - Adds notification to pending notification queue for operators

### Protobuf Changes (`protobuf/node.proto`)

- Added `ImmediateTrigger = 5` to the `MessageOp` enum
- Regenerated protobuf bindings to include the new operation type

### Operator Side (`operator/process_message.go`)

1. **Message Processing Enhancement**: Added handling for `MessageOp_ImmediateTrigger` operations:
   - Extracts task ID from message metadata
   - Determines trigger type (block vs. time/cron) from task metadata
   - Calls appropriate immediate execution function

2. **Immediate Execution Functions**:
   - `executeImmediateBlockTrigger()`: Fetches current block data from RPC and sends trigger notification
   - `executeImmediateTimeTrigger()`: Creates current timestamp data and sends trigger notification

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: Manual block trigger request sent to aggregator
2. **Aggregator Processing**: Detects block trigger and instructs operator via `ImmediateTrigger` message
3. **Operator Execution**: Operator receives instruction, fetches real blockchain data, and triggers workflow
4. **Real Data Flow**: Workflow executes with actual block hash, timestamp, and other blockchain fields

## Key Benefits

- **Real Blockchain Data**: Manual triggers now use current block hash, timestamp, and other real blockchain fields
- **Consistent Architecture**: Maintains separation of concerns (operator fetches data, aggregator coordinates)
- **No Logic Duplication**: Reuses existing operator trigger mechanisms
- **Clean Implementation**: Uses existing notification system for operator communication

## Files Modified

1. `protobuf/node.proto` - Added ImmediateTrigger operation
2. `core/taskengine/engine.go` - Added immediate trigger instruction logic
3. `operator/process_message.go` - Added immediate trigger handling and execution functions

## Usage

When triggering a block trigger task manually via API:
```json
{
  "task_id": "task_id_here",
  "trigger_type": "TRIGGER_TYPE_BLOCK"
}
```

The system now:
1. Instructs the operator to trigger immediately
2. Operator fetches current block data (blockHash, timestamp, etc.)
3. Workflow executes with real blockchain data instead of placeholder values

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Build succeeds without compilation errors
- Protobuf bindings generate correctly
- Quick test suite passes (with existing test issues unrelated to this change)
- New message handling works correctly
