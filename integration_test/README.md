# Integration Tests for Operator Reconnection

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests for the operator reconnection and task assignment functionality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About These Tests

**These tests are EXCLUDED from regular test runs** because they:
- Take 17-53 seconds each to complete
- Often fail due to timing and race condition sensitivity  
- Are meant for debugging specific scenarios, not regular CI/CD

They use the `//go:build integration` tag and must be run explicitly with `make test/integration`.

## Test Files

### 1. `operator_reconnection_test.go`
**Comprehensive end-to-end reconnection testing**

### 3. `orphaned_task_reclamation_test.go` 
**Focused testing for specific fixes implemented**

- `TestOrphanedTaskReclamation`: Tests our core fixes
  - ‚úÖ Orphaned task reclamation after disconnection
  - ‚úÖ Multiple consecutive reconnections
  - ‚úÖ Task assignment consistency
  - ‚úÖ Verifies no tasks are lost during reconnection

  - ‚úÖ Lower MonotonicClock reconnection handling  
  - ‚úÖ Task tracking reset verification

## Running the Tests

### Recommended: Use Make Targets
```bash
# Run all integration tests (from project root)
make test/integration

# Run regular tests (excludes integration tests) 
make test

# Run ALL tests including integration tests (not recommended)
make test/all
```

### Individual Tests (Manual)
```bash
# Test specific reconnection scenario
go test -v -tags=integration -run TestOrphanedTaskReclamation ./integration_test/

# Test ticker context management
go test -v -tags=integration -run TestTickerContextRaceCondition ./integration_test/

# Test connection stabilization  
go test -v -tags=integration -run TestOperatorConnectionStabilization ./integration_test/
```

### All Integration Tests (Manual)
```bash
# From project root
go test -v -tags=integration ./integration_test/
```

### With Detailed Logging
```bash
go test -v -tags=integration ./integration_test/ -args -verbose
```

## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Scenarios Covered

1. **Normal Reconnection Flow**
   - Initial connection and task assignment
   - Clean disconnection 
   - Reconnection with task reclamation
   - Subscription recreation

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Same MonotonicClock reconnection
   - Lower MonotonicClock reconnection
   - Rapid consecutive reconnections
   - Multiple operators connecting simultaneously

3. **Race Conditions**
   - Ticker context race conditions
   - Task assignment race conditions
   - Connection cleanup race conditions

4. **Task Assignment Logic**
   - Orphaned task detection and reclamation
   - Round-robin assignment preservation
   - Task tracking reset behavior

### ‚úÖ Fixes Validated

1. **Ticker Context Management**
   - Old tickers properly canceled on reconnection
   - Context-aware ticker loops
   - No hanging connections or goroutines

2. **MonotonicClock Task Reset**
   - Task tracking reset regardless of MonotonicClock value
   - Force reset on ANY reconnection
   - Consistent task delivery

3. **Orphaned Task Reclamation**
   - Tasks reclaimed from empty string assignment
   - Tasks reclaimed when not in assignment map
   - Prevention of task assignment override

## Mock Components

### MockSyncMessagesServer
Simulates operator GRPC stream connections:
- ‚úÖ Task reception tracking
- ‚úÖ Disconnection simulation
- ‚úÖ Context management
- ‚úÖ Error simulation

### SimpleMockServer  
Lightweight version for basic testing:
- ‚úÖ Basic connection simulation
- ‚úÖ Send/receive operations
- ‚úÖ Context cancellation

## Test Data

Tests use simplified task structures that bypass complex validation:
- ‚úÖ EventTrigger tasks for subscription testing
- ‚úÖ Minimal node/edge structures
- ‚úÖ Direct task injection via `AddTaskForTesting()`

## Expected Results

### Successful Test Run Output
```
‚úÖ Task sent on initial connection
‚úÖ Task reclaimed after first reconnection  
‚úÖ Task reclaimed after second reconnection
‚úÖ No hanging connections or race conditions
```

### Performance Expectations
- Each test completes in ~30-45 seconds (due to stabilization periods)
- No memory leaks or hanging goroutines
- Consistent task assignment across reconnections

## Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: Usually indicates ticker context not being properly canceled
2. **Task Not Received**: Check orphaned task reclamation logic
3. **Hanging Connections**: Verify context cancellation in ticker loops

### Debug Logging
Tests include extensive logging:
- Connection start/end events  
- Task assignment and reclamation
- Ticker context management
- Error conditions

### Manual Verification
Run aggregator and operator manually to verify:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start aggregator
./out/ap aggregator --config=config/aggregator.yaml

# Terminal 2: Start operator  
./out/ap operator --config=config/operator.yaml

# Terminal 3: Check status
./out/ap status

# Look for logs:
# - "üîÑ Reclaimed orphaned task for operator"
# - "üì§ Streamed tasks to operator"
# - "‚úÖ Created new subscription during update"
```
