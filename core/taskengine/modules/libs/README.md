# JavaScript Libraries

This directory contains minified versions of common JavaScript libraries that are pre-bundled with the application:

- lodash.min.js: Lodash utility library
- moment.min.js: Moment.js date manipulation library
- uuid.min.js: UUID generation library

These libraries are embedded into the application binary and can be imported using either CommonJS `require` or ES6 `import` syntax in CustomCode nodes.
