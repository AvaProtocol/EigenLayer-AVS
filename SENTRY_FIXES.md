# High-Priority Sentry Alert Fixes

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Panic Recovery in Contract Write Operations**
**Location**: `core/taskengine/vm_runner_contract_write.go:1089`
**Issue**: Panic recovery doesn't properly clean up state
**Risk**: High - Can cause memory leaks and inconsistent execution state

### 2. **Channel Close Panics in Parallel Execution**
**Location**: `core/taskengine/vm.go:3677-3694`  
**Issue**: Race conditions when sending to closed channels
**Risk**: High - Causes worker goroutines to crash

### 3. **Nil Pointer Dereferences in VM Execution**
**Location**: Multiple VM execution paths
**Issue**: Missing nil checks for critical data structures
**Risk**: Medium-High - Causes immediate crashes

### 4. **RPC Connection Failure Cascades**
**Location**: `core/taskengine/engine.go`, `operator/worker_loop.go`
**Issue**: RPC failures not properly isolated
**Risk**: Medium - Can cause operator disconnections

### 5. **JavaScript Execution Memory Leaks**
**Location**: `core/taskengine/vm.go:1848`
**Issue**: Otto VM contexts not properly cleaned up
**Risk**: Medium - Memory usage grows over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Fixes

### Fix 1: Enhanced Panic Recovery with State Cleanup
### Fix 2: Race-Safe Channel Operations  
### Fix 3: Comprehensive Nil Safety Guards
### Fix 4: Circuit Breaker for RPC Operations
### Fix 5: JavaScript VM Context Pooling

## üìä Expected Impact
- **Reduce Sentry alerts by ~80%**
- **Improve system stability under load**
- **Better error isolation and recovery**
- **Reduced memory usage and leaks**
