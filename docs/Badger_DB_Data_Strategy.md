Based on my analysis of the AvaProtocol/EigenLayer-AVS codebase, here's how the system handles data deletion and retention for workflows and execution data within BadgerDB:

Workflow Deletion and Cancellation
The codebase provides two distinct mechanisms for removing workflows:

DeleteTask: Completely removes workflow data from storage by deleting both the task storage key and task user key, then notifies operators to stop monitoring. engine.go:2346-2410

CancelTask: Changes the workflow status to Canceled, moves the data to canceled status storage, and removes it from the active tasks memory map while preserving the data in BadgerDB. engine.go:2412-2491

Both operations prevent executing tasks from being deleted or canceled to maintain data integrity.

Data Storage Structure and Persistence
The system uses a structured key-value approach in BadgerDB where tasks are stored with status-based prefixes like "t:a:" for active tasks and "t:c:" for canceled tasks. schema.go:22-24

Execution history is stored with keys following the pattern "history:{taskId}:{executionId}" and trigger data is cached with "trigger:{taskId}:{executionId}" patterns. 20250128-120000-protobuf-structure-cleanup.go:172-178

Cleanup Mechanisms
The system implements several cleanup mechanisms:

Periodic Queue Cleanup: Automated cleanup of orphaned jobs runs every hour in production and every 5 minutes in development mode. task_engine.go:106-114

Queue Orphan Cleanup: A dedicated cleanup process removes jobs for tasks that no longer exist, tracking statistics like total jobs processed, orphaned jobs found, and removal counts. cleanup.go:16-76

BadgerDB Vacuum: Manual garbage collection is available through a REPL command that runs BadgerDB's value log garbage collection with a 0.7 threshold. db.go:394-396 repl.go:138-144

Data Retention Policies
No Automatic Retention: The codebase does not implement automatic time-based retention policies for completed or canceled workflows. Tasks persist indefinitely in BadgerDB unless explicitly deleted.

Expired Task Detection: While the system detects expired tasks through the IsRunable() method that checks if a task's expiration time has passed, task.go:303-312 expired tasks are not automatically cleaned up from storage.

Migration-Based Cleanup: The system includes migrations that clean up incompatible data structures and old execution history during version upgrades, but this is not regular retention. 20250128-120000-protobuf-structure-cleanup.go:171-245

Execution Data Retention
Permanent Storage: Execution history, including steps, results, and error data, is stored permanently in BadgerDB without automatic cleanup or archival policies.

Manual Cleanup Only: Past execution data is only removed through explicit deletion operations, migrations, or manual database maintenance operations.

Notes
The AvaProtocol/EigenLayer-AVS system prioritizes data preservation and auditability over storage optimization. There are no built-in automatic retention policies for completed or canceled workflows, and past execution data persists indefinitely. Data cleanup is primarily manual or migration-driven rather than automated, requiring administrator intervention for storage management. The BadgerDB vacuum operation must be manually triggered to reclaim storage space from deleted data.
