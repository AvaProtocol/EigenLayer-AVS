# EventTrigger Expression Not Working - Debug Summary

## Problem Statement

EventTrigger expression returning `null` despite matching transfer events existing:

```
Expression: 0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef&&contracts=[0x7b79995e5f793a07bc00c21412e50ecae098e7f9,0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238]&&from=0xfE66125343Aabda4A330DA667431eC1Acb7BbDA9||to=0xfE66125343Aabda4A330DA667431eC1Acb7BbDA9

Transaction: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x9ff1829f35bd28b0ead18be3c0d9c98dd320e20a87fbad28a6b735d2c7f475cf
Result: null (no aggregator or operator logs)
```

## Debug Steps Added

I've added comprehensive debug logging to the EventTrigger parsing system. When you run your test again, you should see detailed logs showing exactly what's happening during expression parsing.

## Run This to See Debug Output

1. **Start your operator/aggregator** with the EventTrigger task
2. **Look for these log patterns**:

```log
üîç PARSING ENHANCED EXPRESSION expression="..."
üìã Expression parts parts=[...] count=3
üéØ Topic hash topic_hash="0xddf252..."
‚úÖ Parsed contracts contracts=[...] count=2
‚úÖ Parsed FROM||TO from="0xfE66..." to="0xfE66..."
```

## What the Debug Logs Will Reveal

The debug output will show us:
1. **Is the expression being parsed correctly?**
2. **Are contracts extracted properly?**
3. **Are FROM/TO addresses parsed correctly?**
4. **Is the validation rejecting the expression incorrectly?**

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the code analysis, the problem is likely one of:

1. **Expression parsing failure** - The `||` syntax isn't being handled correctly
2. **Validation rejection** - The filter is being incorrectly marked as "too broad"
3. **No task registration** - The task isn't being added to the EventTrigger properly

## Next Steps

**Run your test and share the debug logs**. The logs will immediately show us where the problem is occurring, and I can provide a targeted fix.

The debug logging is now in place in the codebase - just restart your operator/aggregator and run the EventTrigger test again!
